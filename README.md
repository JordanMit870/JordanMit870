Hello! I'm a CS student and aspiring programmer eager to expand my horizons. My passion for computer science was sparked by my love of video gamesâ€”mainly playing themâ€”but I truly discovered my interest in coding during a week-long coding camp early in high school. I was fascinated by how a few lines of code could create something functional and I enjoyed tackling coding challenges like puzzles. While it could sometimes be frustrating, the reward of solving a problem always made it worth it. Now, I'm working through school, steadily progressing toward graduation, and excited for whatâ€™s ahead.
